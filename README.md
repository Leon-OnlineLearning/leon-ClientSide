# LEON Clientside 
This is the client web application for leon

# Getting started

## Running 
It is recommended to start this as a part from the main compose in leon-all, because this application won't be usable (outsid of the landing page and the log in page) as the other pages depend on a state stored elsewhere. But if you want to check this repo ton its own you run the application with
```
npm run dev 
```

## Testing 
To test the application run
```
npm run test
```
